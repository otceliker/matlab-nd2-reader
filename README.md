This code is a very simple wrapper for the Bio-Formats `bfopen` method. The library can be downloaded from the [Bio-Formats downloads page](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/).

For more complicated tasks, refer to the [Bio-Formats in MATLAB guide](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.9.2/users/matlab/index.html).
